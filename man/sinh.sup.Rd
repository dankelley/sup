\title{Hyperbolic sine function}
\usage{
\method{sinh}{sup}(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An uncertain value, in one of three possible forms:
(1) an object of class \code{"sup"}, created with \code{\link[=as.sup]{as.sup()}},
(2) a numeric vector of length two containing a value as the first
entry and its uncertainty as the second entry, or
(3) a numeric vector of length 1, in which case the uncertainty
is assumed to be zero.}
}
\value{
A two-element vector of class \code{"sup"}, which
contains result of the computation as the first entry,
and the uncertainty as the second.  (This class definition
means that printing the item will produce a a well-formated
display.)
